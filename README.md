#Carprice prediction

This project predicts the selling price of a car using machine learning techniques based on features such as year, fuel type, transmission, mileage, and engine details. It helps users estimate a fair price for used cars.

#About

The Car Price Prediction project is a machine learning–based application designed to estimate the selling price of used cars. It analyzes key vehicle attributes such as manufacturing year, fuel type, transmission, mileage, and engine specifications to generate accurate price predictions. The system uses Python and Scikit-learn for model training and Flask to provide a simple web interface, making it easy for users to predict car prices quickly and reliably.
